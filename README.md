# FINANZEN- E-LEARNING WEBSITE
As we all know that in the present times handling finances is not at all easy , and even more for young adults and teenages (i.e. people between 17-22) years of age, they are more prone to spending money , not saving, investing in wrong hands etc. So, itâ€™s necessary to have access to resources , content which help you in managing your finances in a better way. 
For this I have created a website which provides all the contents and resources for beginner level in four main categories. So , that  people from different walks of life to come and learn to better inculcate their learned knowledge in their very own personal finances.

The primary and most important features of our website are as follows:

1. We have a special page built where users may log in with their own unique user IDs in order to save their data on how much they have previously studied and which tests or tutorials are now in progress.
2. For the comfort and flexibility of the students' preferences, we have a Home Page with a variety of themes (all related to finance, as our website's name suggests).
3. We offer a variety of lessons on each topic, which helps users research and discover new information about the corresponding subjects.
4. Each lesson ends with a quiz that is tailored to the users' level of understanding and covers all the material in that tutorial's major course.
