# FINANZEN- E-LEARNING WEBSITE
As we all know that in the present times handling finances is not at all easy , and even more for young adults and teenages (i.e. people between 17-22) years of age, they are more prone to spending money , not saving, investing in wrong hands etc. So, itâ€™s necessary to have access to resources , content which help you in managing your finances in a better way. 
For this I have created a website which provides all the contents and resources for beginner level in four main categories. So , that  people from different walks of life to come and learn to better inculcate their learned knowledge in their very own personal finances.
